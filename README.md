# Web Vulnerability Scanner

This project is a web vulnerability scanner designed to identify potential security issues in a given web application. It leverages Python, Requests, and BeautifulSoup to crawl and analyze the target web application for vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the scanner:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Configuration

- **target_url:** The URL of the web application you want to scan.
- **links_to_ignore:** List of links to ignore during the crawling process.

Update the `target_url` and `links_to_ignore` in the `main.py` file according to your requirements.

## How It Works

1. The scanner starts by crawling the target URL and collecting all the links.
2. The links are saved in a `links.txt` file for future testing.
3. Each link is then tested for XSS vulnerabilities using both form submission and URL manipulation techniques.
4. The results are logged, and if any vulnerabilities are found, appropriate warnings are issued.

## Results

The scanner generates log messages indicating whether a form or URL is vulnerable to XSS attacks. Any discovered vulnerabilities are clearly highlighted in the logs.

### Example Usage

```python
# Set up the scanner
target_url = 'https://github.com/your_username'
links_to_ignore = ['https://github.com/your_username/ignored_link']
scanner = Scanner(target_url, links_to_ignore)

# Crawl the target URL and save links
scanner.crawl()

# Run the scanner to test for XSS vulnerabilities
scanner.run_scanner()
